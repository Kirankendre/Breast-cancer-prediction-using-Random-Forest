# Data Set Information :
The Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) Diagnosis dataset [1] contains the diagnosis and a set of 30 features describing the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digitized image of a of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter);
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values);
perimeter;
area;
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths);
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0);
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour);
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour);
symmetry;
fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1).
The mean, standard error (SE) and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.
